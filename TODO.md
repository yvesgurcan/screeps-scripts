-   Build roads in a 9-tile square around energy sources.
-   Save critical paths in the memory of the room. Critical path are 2-by-2 plain areas (no constructed walls on it). The area must be surrounded with plains on one side and plains on the opposite side and walls (constructed or natural) on the other 2 sides.
-   Check for new critical paths when a builder builds a constructed wall in a room.
-   Build ramparts on critical paths.
-   If energy source dies and harvester has resources in their store, store these resources in extensions/containers.
-   Calculate distance between a source of energy and a container to estimate number, speed, capacity (50 per carry part), and work (2 per work part) of Alfred harvesters.
