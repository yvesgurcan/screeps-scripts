-   If energy source dies and harvester has resources in their store, store these resources in extensions/containers.
-   If extensions are full, switch harvesters to store resources in containers.
-   If containers are full, switch harvesters to store resources in extensions.
-   Calculate distance between a source of energy and a container to estimate number, speed, capacity (50 per carry part), and work (2 per work part) of Alfred harvesters.
