-   Build ramparts on critical paths.
-   Save road to source coordinates in memory.
-   If energy source dies and harvester has resources in their store, store these resources in extensions/containers.
-   Calculate distance between a source of energy and a container to estimate number, speed, capacity (50 per carry part), and work (2 per work part) of Alfred harvesters.
-   Creep recuperates energy lying around in room.
-   Only defend controlled rooms with towers. Still notify in controlled rooms without towers.
-   Add function to deregister critical tiles from memory.
-   Improve towers repair logic by choosing its target randomly.
-   Have builder give a little energy to walls and remparts upon build.
-   Create a harvester type that moves energy from extensions to containers.
